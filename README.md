# NeuSight

NeuSight is a framework designed to predict the performance of deep learning training and inference on various GPUs. For more details, please refer to our paper, [Forecasting GPU Performance for Deep Learning Training and Inference](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3669940.3707265).

## Installation

To install NeuSight as a Python package, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sitar-lab/NeuSight.git
cd NeuSight
pip install -e .
```
- NeuSight was tested on Python 3.9 and PyTorch version 2.1.0.

## Quick Start

We provide two Python scripts for predicting the latency of deep learning execution and training the predictor:

 - `scripts/pred.py` for making predictions
 - `scripts/train.py` for training the predictor

The scripts use GPU and deep learning description files in JSON format, and execution hyperparameters such as batch size. See the scripts in `scripts/example` for examples of how to use these scripts.

## Tool Inputs
NeuSight requires two input files to run: a device configuration file and a deep learning model configuration file.

### Device Configuration File

The device configuration file specifies the architectural parameters of the prediction target GPU. Example configuration files can be found in `data/device_configs`. The configuration file includes
  - `Device`      : User-specified name of the device
  - `Dev_Mem`     : Global memory in GB
  - `Mem_Bw`      : Memory bandwidth of global memory in GB/s
  - `Num_Sm`      : Number of SMs
  - `Core_Per_SM` : Number of CUDA cores per SM
  - `Freq`        : Compute frequency in GHz
  - `SingleFLOPs` : Peak FP32 performance in GFLOPS/s
  - `L2Cache`     : Size of L2 Cache in MB

### Deep Learning Model Configuration File

The deep learning model configuration file specifies the architectural parameters of the target deep learning model. Example configuration files can be found in  `data/DLmodel_configs`. Configuration file are specified in `Hugging Face` model description format.
